  - Quizcrawler :: Quizcrawler is an application that, when fed a file of
    class-notes, crawls the structure and generates interactive quizzes that can be
    used as review. It leverages spaced repetition and forced / active recall to
    enhance learning. The gamification of studying should further increase
    engagement and recall.
