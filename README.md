# Quizcrawler

## What is it?
Quizcrawler is an application that, when fed a file of class-notes, crawls the
structure and generates interactive quizzes that can be used as review. It
leverages spaced repetition and forced / active recall to enhance learning. The
gamification of studying should further increase engagement and recall.

## What am I doing now?
  - Add loads of tests + window fixing (state-stack) [2 cyl]
  - Basic Persistence
  - Fix MC (Similarity)

* Clean up multi-line strings (get rid of whitespace after '\n')
* A nicer interface with colour and ansi terminal features
* Error handling! No more unwrap! Move error handling to main.
* Document the purpose of each module. Including mod.rs
* The QuizDispatcher should be configurable and pick the most needed questions
* If one quiz is more difficult than another, pick it for higher mastery q's (is_applicable)
