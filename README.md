# Quizcrawler

## What is it?
Quizcrawler is an application that, when fed a file of class-notes, crawls the
structure and generates interactive quizzes that can be used as review. It
leverages spaced repetition and forced / active recall to enhance learning. The
gamification of studying should further increase engagement and recall.
