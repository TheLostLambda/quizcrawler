# Quizcrawler

## What is it?
Quizcrawler is an application that, when fed a file of class-notes, crawls the
structure and generates interactive quizzes that can be used as review. It
leverages spaced repetition and forced / active recall to enhance learning. The
gamification of studying should further increase engagement and recall.

## TODO
* Better / smarter answer checking
* Verify that all of the regex is resonable for borg
* Clean up multi-line strings (get rid of whitespace after '\n')
* Set up some unit tests
