# Quizcrawler

## What is it?
Quizcrawler is an application that, when fed a file of class-notes, crawls the
structure and generates interactive quizzes that can be used as review. It
leverages spaced repetition and forced / active recall to enhance learning. The
gamification of studying should further increase engagement and recall.

## What am I doing now?
  1. Add state for showing right / wrong answer
  2. Finishing Quiz implementation
  3. Ability to jump into a quiz
  4. Basic Persistence
  5. Fix MC (Similarity + Diminishing Options)
