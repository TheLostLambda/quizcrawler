// Is it possible to match an identical regex group a second time?
// If so, I should write a regex that matches *'s followed by whitespace and
// should continue until the same number of *'s are encountered again (sibling
// section) or the end of the file is reached. I think I should be able to do
// that with groups.

// Two passes follow, first the body of the section is parsed into questions
// (this may actually involve several subpasses, one for each question type)
// then the body is scanned for children and the process repeats.

// I need to find a way to not double scan the questions within the children â€”
// unless this becomes desirable. Perhaps the children pass happens first and
// those matches are snipped from the string before questions are scanned
// for. It's also possible just to build a second, negated regex that matches
// things that aren't children and scrapes questions from those.
